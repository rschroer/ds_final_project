# Final Project
## Topic Considerations
    1. NCR Data from Ticketing system
        Clean Data
        Predict time case was open with linear regression and if was in SLA with classification

    2. Kaggle Microsoft Malware Pediction
        [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction)
        Predict `HasDetections` based on other feathers

## Rough Project Outline
    1. Pick Topic
    2. Get Data
    3. Clean Data
    4. Exploratory Analysis and Graphing
    5. ML model building and feature engineering
    6. ML refining/analysis. This is an iterative process, will need to revisit 5.
    7. Presentation Building Steps 1-6 _HAVE_ to be complete by start of class on Tuesday 8/6


## Rough Presentation Outline
    1. Intro Screen - 15 seconds give project name, have group names, but don't spend time announcing roster

    2. Exposition 1:45 - Describe the problem and how we picked it. This will match the baseline in Sean's story telling arc. Talk about what is being predicted or why.

    3. Exploratory Analysis 3:00 - Display the initial graphs of the data. Point out something interesting from one of the graphs that may seem counterintuitive. 

    4. ML Discussion: 8:00 - Discuss the models picked, the tuning involved, what when well, what challenges we had.

    5. Wrap up: 1:00 Talk about weaknesses in the models, what findings we had and next steps
