# Final Project
## Topic Considerations

NCR Data from Ticketing system:

- Clean Data.

- Predict time case was open with linear regression and if was in SLA with classification.

Kaggle Microsoft Malware Pediction:
- [Kaggle Link.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction)
- Predict `HasDetections` based on other features.

## Rough Project Outline
1. Pick Topic
1. Get Data
1. Clean Data
1. Exploratory Analysis and Graphing
1. ML model building and feature engineering
1. ML refining/analysis. This is an iterative process, will need to revisit steps 5 and 6
1. Presentation Building Steps 1-6 _HAVE_ to be complete by start of class on Tuesday 8/6


## Rough Presentation Outline
1. Intro Screen `0:15`-  Give project name, have group names, but don't spend time announcing roster

1. Exposition `1:45` - Describe the problem and how we picked it. This will match the baseline in Sean's story telling arc. Talk about what is being predicted or why.

1. Exploratory Analysis `3:00` - Display the initial graphs of the data. Point out something interesting from one of the graphs that may seem counterintuitive. 

1. ML Discussion: `8:00` - Discuss the models picked, the tuning involved, what when well, what challenges we had.

1. Wrap up: `1:00` Talk about weaknesses in the models, what findings we had and next steps
